<h1>Result Management App</h1>

<p align="justify">
CSCResult is an application built as part of a college course - CSC235: Object Oriented Programming. The project focuses on practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm and introduces students to a variety of concepts such as using git and Github, collaborating on Github, working with a real-time database, database schema design, and more.

### Introduction
<p align="justify">
OOP is a fundamental concept for every software developer. The task assigned to us was to build an application using C# that manages the results of computer science students. While working on this project, we were exposed to numerous new concepts beyond OOP, such as events, commands, working with Firebase real-time database, synchronous and asynchronous events, and more.

### Broad Overview
<p align="justify">
The application was divided into two parts: student and admin. Student login details are hardcoded into the database to ensure that only registered students can access the app. Students use their matriculation number as their username and password by default. Similarly, admin login details have been pre-defined. The admin represents an examiner from each faculty. There are five admins in the app: Statistics, Mathematics, GES, Computer Science, and Physics.

### Functionalities
<p align="justify">
Students can register, update, and delete courses. Additionally, students can view their profiles and provisional statements of results. Admins are responsible for assigning scores to respective students. When a student registers for Physics courses, such as PHY102 and PHY103, their details will be automatically reflected in the Physics Dashboard, and the admin can assign the student a score at the appropriate time. Similarly, all statistics-related courses registered by any student will be reflected on the Statistics dashboard, and the admin can take appropriate action.

<a id='limitations'></a>

### Limitations
<p align="justify">

There are a few limitations of this app that should be noted. The developer is not a mobile app developer, and this app should not be assumed to be an ideal working app. Some of the limitations include:
</p>

- The app does not validate a course registered by a student, i.e., whether it exists or not
- The app does not include the reset password, forgot password, or logout functionality
- Constraints are not placed on any data entered by students or admin
- Navigation is not ideally handled
- Constraints are not placed on the number of courses a student can register
- Students can delete and update any course without any restriction
- The app does not allow students to download and print their results
- There are a few more limitations as well. However, the primary objective of this project has been achieved.

<a id='improvements'></a>

### Future Improvements
<p align="justify">
Improvements can be made to this app by addressing the limitations mentioned above. Additionally, a lot of constraints need to be placed on how data is entered, and how users interact with the app. Furthermore, an option to download the result and improved UI/UX are suggested future improvements.
